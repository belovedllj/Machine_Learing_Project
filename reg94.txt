A future meeting will probably work best.  Come visit me the next time you are on campus and we can talk about it.  Dr. Starer did create a LinkedIn group for FE.  I¡¯ll get the link from him.

Hi Sharon,

That is a great idea! We plan on having speakers either alumni or employers come in this semester. I'm curious whether your suggesting this for our welcoming party tomorrow or for the future. Regarding the LinkedIn group, I have already created one for our ssfe club. We always welcome more graduating alumni. Have you guys created another one? Please send link. 

Thanks,
Bo

Hi Bo,
 
I have an idea for SSFE meeting that I would like to discuss with you.  Would it be helpful if a few recent graduates that work in the area came to a meeting to discuss their interview process and how to be successful working in finance?  We have a new LinkedIn group that has several alumni that could be asked.  You might also know some students who would be interested in coming.
 
Thanks, Sharon
