Dear Reader,

Barack Obama has taken a lot of heat for ¡°ObamaCare.¡±

And rightfully so. When the legislation goes into effect in November 2014, it¡¯s going to not only raise taxes, but also drive up prices in many unexpected places.

But guess what¡­

A Washington, DC area financial journalist says there¡¯s something else brewing within the Obama Administration¡­ which is soon going to dwarf Obamacare.

This fellow says most Americans will be shocked when they see the facts about what Obama and the current White House Administration REALLY have in store for us over the next few years.

And this financial journalist says this new development will affect not only your healthcare, but also your bank¡­ your investments¡­ your retirement¡­ your house¡­ and your job if you are still working.

I strongly, strongly encourage you to take just a few minutes to check out this fellow¡¯s recent analysis. It¡¯s a real eye-opener.

And this guy has a pretty remarkable track record of accurately predicting some of the biggest and most important economic developments in the country over the past decade.

Most Americans are going to be caught completely by surprise by this turn of events. I hope you will not be one of them.

We recently posted this financial journalist¡¯s work on our website. You can access it, free of charge, here.

Sincerely,

George Rayburn
