Dear SIAM Student Chapters:
It has come to my attention that many students who are members of SIAM student chapters are not necessarily members of SIAM.
I am writing to invite any student members of your chapter who are not already members of SIAM to join SIAM today. As you know, this is free, since all student members of your chapter are eligible for free SIAM membership. You can find links to details about membership at http://www.siam.org/joinsiam and can join online at https://my.siam.org/JoinSIAM.aspx or download an application and return it to SIAM.
SIAM¡¯s website lists various substantive reasons why it's in your interest to join SIAM. Personally, I think that getting SIAM News and the 30% discount on books are two of the most important. Another advantage is that if you apply for one of SIAM's generous student travel awards for travel to SIAM meetings, being a member of SIAM will provide added weight to your application if all other criteria are equal among candidates. Plus, as a SIAM member you are eligible to be selected by your chapter as the recipient of the annual Certificate of Recognition or as the representative of your chapter to the SIAM Annual Meeting.
At the same time, I think the best reason to join is the more psychological one of simply commitment to one's field. For those of you who will end up making careers in applied mathematics, joining the leading professional society in the field can be part of staying connected and involved and a participant in a worldwide enterprise. To me, that matters more than financial advantages. (But I have to admit a lot of people care more about the financials!)
Maybe you could find a way to encourage other members of the chapter to join up (or renew their memberships) too?
Incidentally, you might ask, "what's in it for SIAM"? Why do I take the trouble to send you this message? Well at the most personal level for me, it's a matter of pride: I want as many students as possible to take advantage of the free membership offered by SIAM.
Then if you look at it from SIAM's point of view, one can also identify various motivations. On the more substantive side of the equation, SIAM wants healthy long-term membership numbers and student membership is a way of encouraging lifelong membership. But for people like me who have been involved with SIAM for years, we believe in applied mathematics and believe it's good for the health of the field if its practitioners feel that extra sense of cohesion and affiliation that comes with membership in a society.
I hope you¡¯ll join me as an active member of SIAM.
Sincerely,
Irene Fonseca
