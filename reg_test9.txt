Peng:

Please fill out the Change of Enrollment form (access the link below) and bring it to the first class session & I'll sign it (or you can ask your adviser to sign the form).  You can then take the signed form to the registrar's office, and they'll help you with the enrollment.

Another option is to print out this email and take it to the registrar's when you register for the course.

Let me know if you run into any issues.

Dear Prof. Kim
        Sorry to bother you again. I went to the SSC today to register class today. Then the register told me the CS 561B need instructor's signature or official approval on email. The best way to get that is  please email me that something like "I got your approval", and copy the email to Diane Arlt( Diane.Arlt@stevens.edu). So she will know I got your official approval.
        My name is Peng Peng, ID:10374672 , Email: ppeng@stevens.edu, The course I so expect to select is CS561B on 2013 Fall.
        Sorry to cause your inconvenience . I will be very grateful if you can help me.
