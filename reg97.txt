Hello SSFE Members,

Hope everyone had the opportunity to attend the Welcome party today (Sept. 12).  We had a good turn out.  

Attached is the Grad Student Workshop schedule. I recommend those of you not familiar with resume writing or interview etiquette attend these workshops. Most importantly, do not forget to activate your Castle Point Career (CPC) accounts ASAP, as most of the campus recruiting (On-campus interviews) require you to submit your resume here in addition to applying on their website.

I did a brief job search, Jeffries, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, KPMG, and Bank of America have plans to conduct on campus interviews for full time and internships thus far.  

Good Luck,
Bo
