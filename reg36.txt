Dear International Student Community,
 
ISSS is currently searching for three new Graduate Student Workers to fill open part-time positions in the ISSS office. The positions are set to begin December 16, 2013, and students should be prepared to work through the end of the Fall 2014 semester.  Duties will include managing the front area, answering phones, filing, assisting with student inquiries, and other duties as needed.  All students interested may apply for this position through the Student Employment website here: http://www.stevens.edu/sit/student-employment.
 
Also, since next week is the Thanksgiving holiday, we wanted to remind you that the ISSS office will be closed from Nov. 27-29 and will reopen on Monday, December 2.
 
If you will be traveling outside the U.S. over the Thanksgiving break, you must have a valid travel signature on your I-20 or DS-2019; please also review our travel guidance before you go: http://www.stevens.edu/sit/isss/travel. Don¡¯t wait until the last minute and risk forgetting to get your I-20/DS-2019 signed before you leave!  ISSS is currently running a special promotion: We have a limited number of free gifts we will give away to students who need a travel signature and come to get one. The giveaways will continue through November 22, while supplies last! When you come, you must have the following documentation: Travel Signature Request form (attached), passport, I-94, and I-20/DS-2019. Free gifts will only be given to students with complete Travel Signature Request packets.  You must drop off your documents before 3 PM, Monday through Friday, and will be able to pick them up the same day after 4 PM.
 
**Be sure to check the 3rd page of your I-20 or the 1st page of your DS-2019 before you come for a signature to make sure you actually need one. Travel signatures are valid for one year for current F-1 students and all J-1 students and 6 months for F-1students on OPT. If you will return to the U.S. before your most recent travel signature expires, you do not need to request a new one at this time.
 
Important: Automated (electronic) I-94
 
Customs and Border Protection has transitioned to an automated (electronic) I-94, so from now on, if you are traveling outside the U.S., in the majority of cases, you will receive only a stamp in your passport when you reenter¡ªnot a paper I-94 card. Your stamp should be designated according to your status:
 
F-1: Your stamp should read ¡°F-1 D/S.¡±
J-1: Your stamp should read ¡°J-1 D/S.¡±
 
After your passport is stamped, while you are still in Customs, check to be sure it is designated properly. If it is not, please request that Customs correct this before you leave the airport. The designation will be important whenever you apply for a government-related benefit, such as a driver¡¯s license, Social Security number, etc.
 
To access your I-94 admission record after reentering the U.S. with an electronic Form I-94, please use the following website: www.cbp.gov/i94. Your name should be entered exactly as it is listed on your passport, but if you cannot find your information this way, try entering your name as it is was listed on your plane ticket, if that spelling is different.
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us!
