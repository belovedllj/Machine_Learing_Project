Graduate Study Zones
In an effort to provide graduate students with designated quiet spaces in which they can study, the Office of Graduate Student Affairs has secured a number of classrooms that will be used as Graduate Study Zones, in addition to the Graduate Student Lounge which is located on floor 2 1/2 of the S.C. Williams Library.

These spaces are for quiet study, not group work. Cell phones and all other electronic devices should be on silent while in these rooms. Classes are held in these locations outside of the hours below, so please plan to exit on time.
