Peng - 

Thank you for speaking to me yesterday at the Stevens Career Fair.  I wanted to drop you a note to let you know we are interested in having you in to our Edison office for an in-person interview.  To set this up I will need an electronic copy of your resume.  It would also be helpful to know what day(s), and time of day, work best for you to come to our Edison location.

You should plan on about 2 1/2 hours for this initial interview; moreover, there will be subsequent interviews for those selected to move on in our process.  Dress here at FAST is business casual.

Thank you for your consideration.

Steve
