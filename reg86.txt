Dear International Student Community,
 
If you have recently graduated, this is a reminder that we have created an e-mail list that you can subscribe to so that you can receive e-mails while you are on post-completion OPT or the STEM extension. We send out many of our usual e-mails to this list, as well as special reminders and updates regarding your F-1 status on OPT. Since you will no longer receive our e-mail updates soon after you complete your studies at Stevens, we strongly recommend that you sign up for this list now.
 
You may subscribe to the list as follows:

Go to https://lists.stevens.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/international_student-opt and enter your e-mail address in the appropriate box.

 
The following e-mail address will appear in the ¡°To¡± field when we send messages to this list: international_student-OPT@lists.stevens.edu.
 
If you have any questions, please let us know.
 
Best Regards,

International Student & Scholar Services
