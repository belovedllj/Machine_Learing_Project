Dear Peng,
 
Thank you for expressing interest in iCIMS!
 
Based on your recent application for Software Development Intern (Winter 2013), I am interested in scheduling a time for us to speak further about your background & qualifications. Can you provide me with some of your availability to conduct a phone screen as well as a number that you can be contacted on?  The call should take roughly 30 minutes.
 
I look forward to discussing our career opportunities with you!
 

Regards,
 
 Nicole Tucker | Talent Acquisition Specialist I | iCIMS
