Dear Mr. Tim Gold,
          Sorry to bother you, I don't know if it is appropriate to send you email to ask some questions.
          This is Enoch,  a Stevens international student.  I almost went to every fellowship meeting at 2012 Fall, but I only went to one meeting at the past semester. It has been a long time. My girlfriend went to Stevens too and we spend a lot time together studying and busying with personal stuffs. So, only went to Stevens Bible studying once.
           Now is the summer break, and I told her a lot about  Bible and Jesus, and we both interested to go to a bible studying again. because there is no Bible studying at Stevens, So could we go to the "Wallace School 12th & Willow " to join you event?  Is it appropriate to just be there for both of us?
           And I don't know whether we could find you there? and the time?
           The email became a little long, you know Chinese love to tell a story and get to the point at last.
            I will be very grateful if you can reply me. 
                                                                      Sincerely, Enoch and Tina
