Hi Sally,
 
Thank you for your time on the phone earlier.
 
I would like to offer this opportunity to Stevens MFE Graduates.

Unfortunately we will not be able to work with individuals here on an H-1 visa.
 
We have had success in fulfilling our client¡¯ s needs for consultants who possess a MFE in the past and are interested in discussing a long-term employment opportunity with a Global Financial Services firm with any interested candidates.
