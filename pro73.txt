Dear Reader,

Obama will go down as the worst President in U.S. history, having put the country on a path to bankruptcy. (He's spending far more than we can ever hope to repay.) But he had a lot of help along the way!

In fact, Congress' ineptitude may soon have much greater consequences for Americans¡­

The United States is now vulnerable to a host of unnerving outcomes, including another debt downgrade, which would likely collapse the economy AND the stock market.

Congress needs to be saved from, well, itself!

If you haven't visited our brand-new "emergency measures" website, www.SaveCongressFromItself.org, I urge you to do so immediately.

You see, our Forefathers knew such a day was coming. And they left behind an ingenious gift for Americans to use as a last resort.

It may represent our only lifeline! We're calling it "The Framers' Secret Resolution."

The mind-blowing details are compiled in an amazing new report called¡­

Save Congress From Itself: The Framers' Secret Resolution.

It's available on the website - FOR FREE - as a service to Americans.
Be a Patriot Today!

As you'll learn in the report, the Framers intended you to know their SECRET and to TAKE ACTION. So raising public awareness may be our only way to save the country.

Just click here to get started now. It won't cost you a penny.

Here's hoping you do your part before it's too late,


Louis Basenese
Founder and Chairman, SaveCongressFromItself.org
