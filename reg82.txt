About the Graduate Enrichment Series
 
The Graduate Enrichment Series, a certificate program designed to provide graduate students with weekly opportunities to develop outside of the classroom, both personally and professionally, by offering sessions on a wide variety of co-curricular topics.
 
Sessions will be led by faculty and staff from numerous departments and offices around campus. Students who attend a minimum of 15 sessions will receive a Certificate of Completion at the end of the academic year and may request a co-curricular transcript detailing the sessions that they attended.
 
The Co-Curricular Transcript serves to highlight a student＊s co-curricular involvement and provides a more holistic view of their learning experience at Stevens. It can increase a student＊s marketability to prospective employers and graduate schools that are seeking well-rounded individuals who take advantage of opportunities for personal and professional development. The CCT is a verifiable university document that bears the Institute＊s Seal.
 
For more information including session topics, descriptions, dates, and times please visit the Graduate Enrichment Series page of the Office of Graduate Student Affairs website at http://gradlife.stevens.edu/Enrichment_Series
