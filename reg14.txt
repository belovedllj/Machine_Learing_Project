¡¤        The ideal candidate will have a MSEE or PhD in EE and should be able to start work within 2-3 months.

¡¤        Unless the person is at the very top of the class, they will need to be U.S. citizens or permanent residents because of the H-1B quota limitations. 

¡¤       Please be sure ALL projects, skills and tools related to experience, whether school or work related, are on resume (over one page is ok)
