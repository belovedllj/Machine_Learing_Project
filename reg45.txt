Dear Graduate Students,

Please see below several important issues.

(1) New sections for courses

Several courses have been closed. Two new sections are now added,

CPE/EE-556-B Computing Princ. of Embedded Sys
EE-810-F Engineering Programming: C++/Java

(2) Study plan

Every graduate student must submit a study plan in the first semester
of study. Your study advisor will review/discuss/approve your study
plan.

Your study plan can also be reviewed and approved by other faculty
members during Study Plan/Advising Events.

(3) Study Plan/Advising Event

We will have a Study Plan/Advising Event this Wednesday (1:30-3:00PM,
Burchard-213).

(4) ECE Graduate Student Council

For program improvement (gathering student input, feedback, etc.) and
enhanced learning experience (e.g., technical clubs, events), we will
establish an ECE Graduate Student Council. We will need at least three
volunteers to start the council activities (president, vice president,
secretary). If you are interested, please come to the advising event
this Wednesday. If you have a team of three members, please come
together.

(5) Graduate student information web site

For easy access and sharing information, we have this web site,
