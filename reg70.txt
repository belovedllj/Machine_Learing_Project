Funds Available for Student Travel to SIAM Conferences
 
Are you planning to participate in a SIAM conference in 2014?  Are you a graduate student?  Then you should be aware that SIAM has funds available to provide partial support for travel to SIAM conferences.  The funds are allocated on a competitive basis, and so you must apply to receive funding.  There is a substantial pool of funds available, enough to make several hundred awards in 2014.  Your chances of success are good if you meet the criteria. 
 
How to apply?  First, general information is available on the web page for SIAM Student Travel Awards.  In some cases, there are other grants to support student travel to SIAM conferences beside the ones listed on this page.  Even if you do not find the conference you wish to attend on the SIAM Student Travel Awards page, continue with the second step below.
 
Second, once you have decided to participate in a specific conference, go to that conference¡¯s web page from the SIAM conference calendar.  Go from there to the conference of your choice.  You will notice, on the right-hand side, a navigation column that includes an item labeled ¡°Travel Support.¡±  Follow the directions listed there.
 
Please note that for 2014, SIAM Student Travel Awards include $650 for domestic travel, plus free conference registration; and $800 for international travel (from one continent to another).   The awards (unless otherwise noted in the award letter) come with free registration.
