Dear Student,
 
I¡¯d like to begin by welcoming you back to Stevens! Now, on to business¡­
 
If you are expecting to complete your degree requirements in the Fall 2013 semester, you must submit an Application for Candidacy (AC) by October 1st, 2013.   Links to the necessary forms can be found on our website:

The Application for Candidacy must be completed, signed by your advisor and submitted to the Registrar's Office. Once your AC is signed by your advisor, you can e-mail or fax it to the Registrar's Office at abrandon@stevens.edu / 201.216.8030. To verify the receipt and status of your Application for Candidacy, go to ¡°My Stevens (https://shibboleth.stevens.edu/idp/Authn/UserPassword),¡±  login to student services and look under "Graduation Checkout."
         
Degrees are awarded twice a year- once in January and once in May-but there is only one commencement ceremony, which is held in May. For information regarding the ceremony, please go to the student life website (http://ugstudentlife.stevens.edu/ ) and click on ¡°Graduation Guide.¡± The updated information will not be available until March.
 
The Office of Student Life will send out important information about commencement to your STEVENS E-MAIL account ONLY. Be sure you are checking that account, or have it forwarded to an e-mail address that you frequently access.
 
Please feel free to contact me with any questions, and congratulations on your upcoming graduation!
 
Sincerely,
 
Aylin Brandon
