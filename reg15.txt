Something urgent has come on my side that needs my attention this afternoon and I will have to cancel our meeting.
 
Any chance you can meet one afternoon early next week (Mon, Tues or Weds).  Ideally 4pm would work for me but I have some flexibility to rearrange my schedule.
 
Apologies for the late change of plans.
