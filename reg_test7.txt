Hello!
I hope that your summer is off to a great start! I reached out to you a few weeks ago regarding some important information for your last year here at Stevens. I will be your career counselor for your last year (that is unless you are already working with a counselor here in the office, you can continue to work with that individual). Please e-mail me an updated WORD DOCUMENT copy of your resume so I can begin to edit it so it can be ready for the 2014 Resume Book!
Items for your Calendars:
 1.       Please submit your draft resume to me for the Resume eBook (which will be distributed to employers beginning in September) by June 30.th You can leave the bullet points blank for your Summer 2013 experience for now. We will request a final copy of your resume at the end of the summer.
 2.       If you have not yet attend a Career Prep Workshop, attend our Early Bird Career Prep on August 22nd from 6-7pm in the Bissinger Room. We will continue to offer Career Prep Workshops when classes begin but the earlier you can attend the better!

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me!
Regards,
Ariel

to me 
Peng,
 
Thank you for sending me your resume. I made a few format changes so it is easier to read. Please add some bullets for your work experience explaining what you did as a teacher and what skills you used to be successful. You want as much related experience as possible on your resume so if you  have completed any other projects throughout your education I would suggest adding them. Please add a title for the project you have listed. For the projects, make sure you add bullets explaining the project as well. Please update it and send it back to me. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask.
 
Regards,
Ariel

Dear Ariel Mone,
     Thank you so much for the revise, I am so grateful for your conscientious And responsible work.
      I did some change and attached it.
      I taught high school teacher for more than two years both in full-time and part-time. However I couldn't find to much words to describe it, because I still feel that that experience does not match my major here. 
      I studied theoretical physics in collage, so, I do not have too much project to write out. Sad about me -_-!
       I keep studying hard in here. I hope I could make a great improvement to enrich the contents of my resume.
         Thanks again for your selfless help. Looking forward to hearing your reply.
                                                                                                         Sincerely, Peng Peng

Eric,
 
Your resume looks good. I pulled out the coursework to highlight it more so that you have more related experience on your resume. I moved the academic projects up too. If you can add more information about what you did for the projects that would highlight more of your technical skills that would be great. Overall it looks good!

Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Regards,
Ariel
