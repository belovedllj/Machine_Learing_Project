Dear Professor Dentcheva,
 
    I'm organizing the following workshop in two weeks, and I thought it might be of some interest to you. Also I'm wondering whether you can distribute the following workshop announcement to your department or whoever might be interested? I really appreciate your help!
 
Best wishes,
 
Xiaodong
