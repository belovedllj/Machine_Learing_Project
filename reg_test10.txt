Dear Dr. Yan Wang,
     Sorry to bother you. We a an question about the connection between Sentilla mote project and client project. We stuck at this problem for several days.
        We want to run the "AcceleratorButton.java" at the MoteProject Side to trigger the programs at the ClientProject. So we could shake the mote at Y-axis to trigger the program at ClientProject side.
         We tried several approaches at the "Sender" and "receiver" following the lecture PPT.  But We still got confused....Could you give us some useful advices to help us out.
        Thanks you in advance. We will be vary grateful if you can reply us soon.
                                                                Sincerely, Peng Peng
