Thank you.

You¡¯ve taken the added security step and provided a rescue email address. Now all you need to do is verify that it belongs to you.

The rescue email address is dedicated to your security and allows Apple to get in touch if any account questions come up, such as the need to reset your password or change your security questions. As promised, Apple will never send any announcements or marketing messages to this address.

When using Apple products and services, you¡¯ll still sign in with your primary email address as your Apple ID.

It¡¯s about protecting your identity. 
Just so you know, Apple sends out an email whenever someone adds or changes a rescue email address associated with an existing Apple ID. If you received this email in error, don¡¯t worry. It¡¯s likely someone just mistyped their own email address when creating a new Apple ID. 

If you have questions or need help, visit the Apple ID Support site.

Thanks again,

Apple Support
