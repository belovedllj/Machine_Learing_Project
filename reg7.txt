Bi-Weekly Note: Since the 2nd Bi-weekly payroll will be run early, 12/19/13, you will need to estimate what you will be working for the remainder of the period from 12/19 to 12/29; any corrections can be done via an email to Payroll when we return from the holiday recess to be adjusted in the 1/16/14 pay date run.
 
Monthly Payroll Note: Please note the pay-date for the monthly payroll will fall on the last day of the month, Tuesday, December 31st, in accordance with our regular monthly payroll pay date schedule. We will be having our payroll service company mail out the live checks and pay stubs, for direct deposit recipients, directly to employees on 12/26/13 for the Tuesday, December 31st pay date.  Please make sure that you have the correct mailing address setup.
 
If you have any questions, please contact the Payroll Help Desk by calling 201-216-5150 or by email at payroll@stevens.edu.  Please note the telephone is manned from 9AM until 5PM, Monday through Friday on University business days.
