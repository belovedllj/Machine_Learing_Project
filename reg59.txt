Programs for International Students
Friday, October 25th
 

 
Hi everyone!

Thank you all to those who came to our Halloween Party last night - we had a blast! For those of you who couldn't make it, don't worry, we still have quite a few events coming up.

Among those events is our first Cultural Cuisine of the semester! Every month or so, we'll try out restaurants of different ethnic backgrounds - this month, Ethiopian food will be on our tables, but perhaps Ukrainian, Vietnamese or Peruvian dishes will be next! If you have any good restaurant recommendations, please let Aline know at aline@one-to-world.org.

The one year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy is just around the corner. While the tragedy seems far past to most of us, many people are still struggling with the aftermath of the superstorm and quite a bit of work remains to be done. Have a look at our special section dedicated to this anniversary to see how you can get involved in the reconstruction efforts, and volunteer some of your time to help those who lost so much in the storm.

Cultural Cuisine at Meske Ethiopian Restaurant 
Wednesday, October 30th 

 
Have you ever had Ethiopian food before? One To World is excited to announce its first Cultural Cuisine of the semester! Join us as we explore the delicately balanced flavors of Ethiopian Cuisine at Meske, a restaurant located in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan. A Yelp reviewer wrote: "I'd probably eat here every night if I lived in NYC. Worth every penny. Worth every bite."
 
Eating Ethiopian food is a great social dining experience! The food is eaten with your hands, and injera (Ethiopian national bread) is used as both plate and utensils to spoon the food.

The menu for the evening is designed specially for One To World guests. You will be able to choose a drink, an appetizer and an entree from the list below, which will be served family style.
 
Appetizers
> Beef Sambosa - Homemade flatbread stuffed with chopped prime beef, hot green pepper, onion, and garlic.
> Vegetarian Sambosa - Homemade flatbread stuffed with lentils, hot green pepper, onion, and garlic.
 
Entrees 
> Special Tibs - boneless leg of lamb sauteed with Ethiopian honey wine, onions, fresh tomatoes, green peppers and finished with awaze (hot pepper paste).
> Doro Wat - chicken sauteed with onions, garlic, fresh ginger and berbere spices in butter and red wine.
> Vegetarian Specialties - including split lentils with curry and ginger, berbere sauce-seasoned split lentils and ground chickpeas, potatoes and carrots sauteed with ginger and garlic, etc.
 
All entrees will come with a platter of injera bread.
