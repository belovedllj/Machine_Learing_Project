The shuttle will immediately return to the Howe center and conduct a complete loop at 8:40pm and 9:10pm. The shuttle will resume normal operation at 9:30pm.
Please be mindful of the fact that the shuttle is only allowed to operate with seated passengers. To download the Stevens Shuttle tracking app, click here and follow the instructions.
