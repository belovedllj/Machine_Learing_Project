Good Afternoon INCOSE Members,  
This is a reminder that Dr. Wilson Felder, the former director of the FAA research facility, is speaking today at 4pm on the 5th floor of Babbio in the conference room. If you are free we hope to have you join us for this event. For those who come to the talk we have cupcakes from crumbs.
Hope to see every one there,
