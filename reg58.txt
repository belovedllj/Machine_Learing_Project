Hi Peng,
 
I¡¯m a recruiter at Epic, a worldwide leader in healthcare software, and I recently came across your resume through Stevens Institute of Technology.  Based on your skills and interests, I encourage you to apply for our Problem Solver team.
You may be unfamiliar with Epic, but chances are that our software touches the life of someone close to you.  We create and implement a wide range of integrated software products used by many of the largest and most respected healthcare organizations in the country to improve the quality of patient care.  We are growing steadily; our software is currently used to care for about 157 million people across the United States (that's 50% of Americans).

At Epic, we don¡¯t buy into the stereotype that interpersonal and technical skills are mutually exclusive.  We provide meaningful opportunities to take ownership of challenging projects and make a difference at some of the nation¡¯s most respected healthcare providers.  You¡¯ll work directly with our customers¡¯ IT directors to build strong relationships while providing sound technical guidance.  There¡¯s no need to have a background in healthcare or software - we¡¯ll provide you with extensive training to make sure you have the skills you need to succeed.
