Dear International Student and Scholar Community,
 
Customs and Border Protection has transitioned to an automated (electronic) I-94, so from now on, if you are traveling outside the U.S., in the majority of cases, you will receive only a stamp in your passport when you reenter¡ªnot a paper I-94 card. Your stamp should be designated according to your status:
 
F-1: Your stamp should read ¡°F-1 D/S.¡±
J-1: Your stamp should read ¡°J-1 D/S.¡±
 
After your passport is stamped, while you are still in Customs, check to be sure it is designated properly. If it is not, please request that Customs correct this before you leave the airport. The designation will be important whenever you apply for a government-related benefit, such as a driver¡¯s license, Social Security number, etc.
 
To access your I-94 admission record after reentering the U.S. with an electronic Form I-94, please use the following website: www.cbp.gov/i94. Your name should be entered exactly as it is listed on your passport, but if you cannot find your information this way, try entering your name as it is was listed on your plane ticket, if that spelling is different.
 
If you have any questions, please let us know.
 
Best Regards,
