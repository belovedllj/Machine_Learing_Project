Dear Peng,
 
If you have already waived your health insurance and have an e-mail acknowledgement from University Health Plan, you may disregard this e-mail.
 
Your account has been charged for the premium cost of health insurance in accordance with the New Jersey law that mandates that all full-time students have health insurance.
 
If you want to be covered under this policy, no further action is required at this time.
 
If you do not wish to be covered under this policy and have comparable coverage, please complete the on-line insurance waiver at www.universityhealthplans.com.  You must provide your Campus Wide ID (CWID) not your Social Security Number.  When you have successfully submitted the on-line insurance waiver, you will receive an e-mail confirmation.  Please print/save this confirmation for future reference. 
 
Full-time students, who do not submit a waiver by the September 13, 2013 deadline, will be automatically enrolled in the plan.  There will be no waivers accepted after this deadline.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Office of Student Financial Services
