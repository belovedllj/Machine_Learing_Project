Graduate Study Zones
In an effort to provide graduate students with designated quiet spaces in which they can study, the Office of Graduate Student Affairs has secured a number of classrooms that will be used as Graduate Study Zones, in addition to the Graduate Student Lounge which is located on floor 2 1/2 of the S.C. Williams Library.

These spaces are for quiet study, not group work. Cell phones and all other electronic devices should be on silent while in these rooms. Classes are held in these locations outside of the hours below, so please plan to exit on time.

Shuttle Schedule

Due to the extremely high volume of riders after the conclusion of evening classes, the shuttle schedule has been modified to pick up commuter students at 6th & Hudson at 8:30 and 9:00 PM and will take them directly to the 8th Street elevator.

The shuttle will immediately return to the Howe center and conduct a complete loop at 8:40pm and 9:10pm. The shuttle will resume normal operation at 9:30pm.

Please be mindful of the fact that the shuttle is only allowed to operate with seated passengers. To download the Stevens Shuttle tracking app, click here and follow the instructions.
