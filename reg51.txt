Dear International Student Community,
 
Happy Thursday! The semester is over halfway through, so we wanted to give you answers to some of the big questions we receive each semester. We hope these are helpful to you!:
 
Frequently Asked Questions
 
1.       What if my I-20/DS-2019 end date is in December of 2013, but I am not finishing my classes this semester?

 

If your I-20/DS-2019 is ending this semester and you will need more time to complete your studies, you must have your I-20/DS-2019 extended before its expiration date. Please contact us immediately to apply for a program extension if you are in this situation. If you are scheduled to complete this term but are concerned your GPA may be too low, you should also apply for a program extension. You cannot extend your I-20/DS-2019 after its end date, so you may need to apply for an extension as a precautionary measure. Information and forms for applying for an F-1 program extension are on our website here under ¡°Program Extension¡±; J-1 program extension forms are listed under ¡°J-1 Student Forms¡±: http://www.stevens.edu/sit/isss/forms.

 
 
2.      I have been accepted into a new degree program (master¡¯s or Ph.D.). Do I need a new I-20/DS-2019?

 
If you are completing a degree program this semester and starting a new one in the spring, you must be issued a Change of Level I-20. If you have not already been in contact about this with us, please review the ¡°Change of Level Information and Checklist¡± on our website here: http://www.stevens.edu/sit/isss/forms. You should apply for a Change of Level I-20 no later than forty-five days after the program end date listed on your current I-20.

 

If you are a master¡¯s student who has not yet finished your master¡¯s requirements but have been accepted into a Ph.D. program, you must be issued a Change of Program I-20 before you start taking Ph.D. classes. Please contact ISSS for details.

 

If you are a J-1 student who is finishing your current degree program and will begin another at a higher degree level next semester, you must also apply for and be issued a new DS-2019 for ¡°matriculation¡± from one education level to another before beginning your new program of study.  This process should be completed before your current program end date.  Please contact Caitlin Ross at cross@stevens.edu if you are considering changing levels for instructions on what documents you will need to submit in order to receive your new DS-2019.

 
 
3.      I am going to travel outside the U.S. during Thanksgiving/the winter break. What should I do?

 
You must have a valid travel signature, and please also review our travel guidance before you go: http://www.stevens.edu/sit/isss/travel. Don¡¯t wait until the last minute and risk forgetting to get your I-20/DS-2019 signed before you leave!  Starting next week, ISSS is running a special promotion: We have a limited number of free gifts we will give away to students who need a travel signature and come to get one. The giveaways will continue for the next two weeks (Nov. 11-22) while supplies last! When you come, you must have the following documentation: Travel Signature Request form (attached), passport, I-94, and I-20/DS-2019. Free gifts will only be given to students with complete Travel Signature Request packets.  You must drop off your documents before 3 PM, Monday through Friday, and will be able to pick them up the same day after 4 PM.
 
**Be sure to check the 3rd page of your I-20 or the 1st page of your DS-2019 before you come for a signature to make sure you actually need one. Travel signatures are valid for one year for current F-1 students and all J-1 students and 6 months for F-1students on OPT. If you will return to the U.S. before your most recent travel signature expires, you do not need to request a new one at this time.
 
            Important: Automated (electronic) I-94
 
Customs and Border Protection has transitioned to an automated (electronic) I-94, so from now on, if you are traveling outside the U.S., in the majority of cases, you will receive only a stamp in your passport when you reenter¡ªnot a paper I-94 card. Your stamp should be designated according to your status:
 
F-1: Your stamp should read ¡°F-1 D/S.¡±
J-1: Your stamp should read ¡°J-1 D/S.¡±
 
After your passport is stamped, while you are still in Customs, check to be sure it is designated properly. If it is not, please request that Customs correct this before you leave the airport. The designation will be important whenever you apply for a government-related benefit, such as a driver¡¯s license, Social Security number, etc.
 
To access your I-94 admission record after reentering the U.S. with an electronic Form I-94, please use the following website: www.cbp.gov/i94. Your name should be entered exactly as it is listed on your passport, but if you cannot find your information this way, try entering your name as it is was listed on your plane ticket, if that spelling is different.
 
 
4.      When should I apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Academic Training?

 
If you are graduating this semester and would like to apply for post-completion OPT (F-1) or Academic Training (J-1), it¡¯s not too late! For F-1 students, you must submit an application to our office at least two weeks before your F-1 status ends (i.e., no later than 45 days after the program end date on the first page of your I-20); we recommend that you apply now if you know that you want to do OPT. For J-1 students, you must apply for Academic Training before the end date on your DS-2019, and the employment must commence within 30 days of the program completion. As a reminder, information about all types of F-1 work authorization and videos about CPT and OPT are located on our website here under ¡°Off-Campus Employment.¡± Information about J-1 Academic Training is located here.

 

 

5.      Next semester is my final semester, and I will graduate. Can I take my final class online?

No. If you have only one class to complete, that class must be on campus. If you have two classes remaining, you may take one online and one on campus. If you will not be in your final semester or have three classes remaining, you must take at least six credits on campus; the remainder may be online.

 

 

6.      I would like to invite my friend or family member to visit me in the U.S. What should I do?
