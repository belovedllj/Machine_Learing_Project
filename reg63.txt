Get your tickets now!
 

In just three short days, we'll be celebrating Halloween with some 200 international students - witches, mummies, ghosts and more will be meeting on the dance floor of the Canal Room in Soho. Join them for an evening of dancing, sweets and fun!
 
Get some friends together for a group price ($20/ticket for groups of 5+) or come solo, ready to meet spooky new friends around bowls of candy.

See below for more information about the party and the links to purchase the tickets.  
 
We can't wait to celebrate with you!
