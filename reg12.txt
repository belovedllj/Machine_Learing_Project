Hello Peng,

It was very nice meeting you at the Career Fair and thanks for the interest in the opportunity.  I'm thinking perhaps we should try and schedule a site visit to Triveni sometime over you semester break.  I imagine you're quite busy now with finals, but when does your semester break start/end?  Let me know I and can see what time frame works best for us mutually.

Regards,
Dave
