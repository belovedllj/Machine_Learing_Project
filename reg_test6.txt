Subject: [SIAM-OPT] Job opportunity at Boeing
 
Dear members of the SIAM Activity Group on Optimization,
 
I wanted to call your attention to a job opportunity here at Boeing.  The official job announcement can be found at http://jobs-boeing.com/washington/advanced-technology/jobid3841473-applied-mathematician-3-jobs.  We are looking for an early career researcher in numerical optimization, and I¡¯m sure many of you have current or former graduate students or post docs who would be very attractive job candidates for us.  Indeed, many of you may actually be current or recent graduate students who would be ideal candidates for this job.
 
I will be at the SIAM Annual Meeting the week after next, and I will be happy to talk with any of you about this opportunity and what it is like to work for Boeing in general.
 
Regards,
 
Tom
